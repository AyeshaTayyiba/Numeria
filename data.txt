Grade 1
Here are some of the knowledge and skills that students will learn.

Number
Students work with numbers up to 50 and begin to develop an understanding of the ways we use numbers. They are also introduced to the idea of fractions, through the context of sharing things equally.

Algebra
Students begin to look at how patterns can be used to make predictions. They also begin to work on the idea that in a number sentence (for example, 2 + 2 = 4) both sides must be equal to each other. These ideas are foundational to algebra work in later grades. Students will begin to write code to order a sequence of steps. They will also be introduced to mathematical modelling to analyze and create solutions for real-life situations, such as creating a seating arrangement for a class event.

Data
Students begin to develop their understanding about data by setting out to answer a question of interest (for example, “What type of animals do my classmates like?”). They organize this data into categories, and then display this information in a graph or table that will support them in drawing conclusions.

Spatial sense
Students develop their spatial sense as they compare the length, mass and capacity of different objects as well as learn how calendars are organized to describe time. They also learn specific language to describe different shapes.

Financial literacy
Students learn to recognize Canadian coins and bills and compare their values.

Social emotional learning skills and mathematical processes
Students learn about positive motivation, and how to use self talk strategies such as “I’ve done this before so I know I can do it again” as encouragement that they can do it or to encourage peers when counting.
